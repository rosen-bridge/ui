        To secure your assets, send two of your three WID tokens to another
        wallet (preferably a cold wallet) as soon as possible after setting up
        this Watcher.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Do not</strong> send all three WIDsâ€”you must keep one here
            for your Watcher to function correctly.

            <strong>Moving all WIDs</strong> transfers your permits, rewards,
            and collateral to the new address.

        To unlock permits, move one WID back here, unlock, and then immediately
        send it back to your secure wallet. This keeps your assets protected.
